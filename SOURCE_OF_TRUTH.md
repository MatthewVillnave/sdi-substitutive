# SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md

## 1. Project Goal

SDI-Substitutive tests whether expensive resident tensors can be replaced by a lower-cost packed tensor plus a compressed residual correction, while keeping W_ref absent from the substitutive runtime path.

This project is currently tensor/runtime research only.

**Forbidden:**
- no model quality claim
- no behavior recovery claim
- no speedup claim
- no full-model memory claim
- no llama.cpp integration claim
- no production claim

## 2. Current Canonical Architecture

Canonical formula:
```
W_low_runtime = decode(.sdiw packed W_low)
R_runtime = W_ref - W_low_runtime
Y_sub = X @ W_low_runtime + X @ R_runtime
```

Residuals generated from raw/ideal W_low are invalid for current claims.

## 3. Accepted Known-Good Facts

Current accepted facts:

- Additive sidecar path is archived as a negative residency result.
- Substitutive path is the active research direction.
- Runtime-consistent residual source is mandatory: `R = W_ref - decode(packed W_low)`
- k=9% is the current selected policy by gate-based selection:
  - margin > 0
  - margin >= 256KB preferred
  - best approximation among preferred-margin passers
- k=7% is conservative fallback.
- k=12% is accuracy-experimental only because margin is too thin.
- k=15% fails memory.
- No future phase may use a weighted score as final policy selector unless Matt approves the scoring rule.

## 4. Invalidated / Superseded Claims

List claims that must not be reused:

- Any result using residuals generated as `R = W_ref - W_low_raw` is historical only.
- Earlier low-MAE reports from raw-W_low residuals are invalid for current claims.
- Any "strict substitutive" claim is invalid if substitutive mode generates W_ref internally.
- Any combined ffn_up/ffn_down result is invalid if family-specific orientation or artifact loading is not verified.
- Any manifest runtime result is invalid if it silently falls back to ffn_up artifact paths for ffn_down.

## 5. Suspected / Unproven

Rules:
- Do not put suspected claims in "Accepted Known-Good Facts."
- Do not use suspected claims as the basis for public claims.
- If a later phase verifies a suspected claim, move it to accepted facts.
- If a later phase disproves it, move it to invalidated/superseded claims.

Current suspected/unproven items:

- Combined ffn_up + ffn_down strict runtime may work after manifest/runtime cleanup, but current evidence is not accepted because runtime source-of-truth issues remain.
- ffn_down may remain viable under runtime-consistent residuals, but combined-path validation must be rerun after cleanup.
- Current approximation metrics may change after source-of-truth cleanup.

## 6. Current Open Blockers

Current blockers from repo inspection:

- `phase31x_manifest_runtime.py::execute_substitutive_path()` still synthesizes W_ref internally and regenerates W_low/residual in memory. This must be split into generator/reference mode vs true substitutive runtime.
- `bundle_manifest.py` falls back to ffn_up paths even for other families. Manifest path resolution must be family-aware or require explicit artifact paths.
- `bundle_manifest.py::load_sdiw()` is still placeholder-like and must become a real .sdiw parser returning packed bytes and scale bytes.
- Orientation convention is inconsistent across scripts:
  - k-sweep uses W shape (d_out, d_in) and computes Y = X @ W.T
  - some manifest runtime paths use rows as input and cols as output
 - A single canonical convention must be selected and enforced.
- Dense runtime-consistent residual tests do not prove sparse .sdir encode/decode/apply correctness. .sdir source-of-truth regression is required.

## 7. Canonical Orientation Convention

Select one and enforce everywhere.

**Recommended:**
- Artifact tensor shape = (d_out, d_in)
- Then:
  - W_ref shape = (d_out, d_in)
  - W_low_runtime shape = (d_out, d_in)
  - R_runtime shape = (d_out, d_in)
  - X shape = (d_in,)
  - Y shape = (d_out,)
  - Y = X @ W.T
  - residual bitmap row-major index = row * d_in + col
  - row = output dimension
  - col = input dimension
- ffn_up:
 - d_out = 4864
  - d_in = 896
- ffn_down:
  - d_out = 896
  - d_in = 4864

If this convention is changed, update this file before any code changes.

## 8. Required Regression Before Any New Phase

No new phase may proceed unless this command passes:
```
python -m tests.run_source_of_truth_regression
```

If the command does not exist yet, the next phase must create it.

The regression must test:
- W_low pack/decode roundtrip
- .sdiw parse/apply vs dense decoded W_low
- .sdir encode/decode roundtrip
- .sdir streaming apply vs dense sparse residual apply
- combined stream output vs dense source-of-truth output
- manifest resolves ffn_up and ffn_down separately
- wrong orientation fails fast
- stale/missing paths fail fast
- substitutive mode reports:
  - W_ref_loaded = 0
  - W_ref_generated = 0
  - dense_W_low_materialized = 0
  - dense_R_materialized = 0
  - fallback_count = 0
  - error_count = 0

## 9. Current Allowed Next Phase

Current allowed next phase:
**Phase 31AJ-STABLE — Manifest Runtime Source-of-Truth Cleanup**

Goal:
- Separate fixture generation, manifest loading, and true substitutive runtime.
- Build the one-command source-of-truth regression harness.

Do not continue31AH/31AI until 31AJ-STABLE passes.

## 10. Update Rules

Update this file after every phase.

Rules:
- Add only verified facts.
- Do not add guesses as accepted facts.
- Do not add "probably fixed" as accepted.
- If something is suspected, put it under "Suspected / Unproven."
- Move invalidated claims into "Invalidated / Superseded Claims."
- Do not delete bad history. Mark it superseded.
- If a phase discovers a contradiction, update this file before continuing.
- If code and this file disagree, stop and resolve the disagreement.
- If a requested phase conflicts with this file, stop and report the conflict.
- Do not continue new phase work until contradictions are resolved.

Commit message for future updates:
`Update SOURCE_OF_TRUTH after Phase <phase>`

## 11. Agent Start Instruction

Every agent must start new work with:
> "I have read SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md. The current allowed next phase is _____. I will not proceed if the requested task conflicts with the source of truth."

If the agent cannot say that honestly, it must stop.

## 12. Phase Completion Requirement

From now on, final phase reports must include a SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md section with:
- changed: yes/no
- sections updated
- new accepted facts
- new invalidated/superseded claims
- new suspected/unproven claims
- current blockers
- current allowed next phase

If this section is missing, the phase is not complete.
